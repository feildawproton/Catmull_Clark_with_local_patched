# Catmull_Clark_with_local_patched
Another old school project.  This one tests how memory optimization could affect Catmull-Clark algorithm

# Catmull-Clark with CUDA and openMP
- Splines
  - “Infinite” resolution
  - Smooth curves
  - Hard to animate and texture
- Meshes
  - Easy to model and texture
  - Easy to animate
  - Rough/Imperfect surface
  - Large footprint
- Subdivision surface
  - Combine both
  - Mesh acts as B-spline
